# devopsProjects-dockerWithNginx

# Overview

# Tasks
The goal of the project is to operationalize a web app using **Kubernetes**, an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. 

## The project further involves:

* The pipeline is set up using a GitHub repository for the code that has a link made available in order to expedite review
* The pipeline further uses a centralized image repository to store successfully built images after each clean build
* A linting step in the code pipeline (see screenshots in project zip file)
* Completing a **Dockerfile** to containerize the application in the course of the pipeline and using the Dockerfile to create a **Docker** container
* Deploying the **Docker** container to a **Kubernetes cluster** using Cloudformation or Ansible that is included in the source code 
* Using a deployment methodology (i.e., Blue/Green Deployment or Rolling Deployment) to successfully deploy the container in the selected environment
